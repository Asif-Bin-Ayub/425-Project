# Table of plots & animations:
Type down the plots or animations you think we should do in the report. 

## Part 1
### Plots
1. Phase space plots showing oscillatory motion
2. Period vs l plot
3. Period vs oscillations amplitude plot
4. Shape of C2 (Cycloid)
5. Theta vs t plot showing underdamped/overdamped behaviours
6. Amplitude vs driving frequencies for resonance
7. Fd vs amplitude to investigate chaos
8. (Poincar√© sections & Bifurcation diagrams, if there is chaos)

### Animations
1. Animations for the motion with different l's and different amplitudes, to showcase period behaviour.
2. Animations for underdamped/overdamped motion
3. Animation for motion under increasing Fd (3 Fd's in 1)
4. (Chaotic motion, if it exists)

## part 2
### Plots
1. Circular path / or semi-circular path (the same as simple pendulum)
2. 3 closed paths, prefer to be different (Choose values from Asif)
3. 3 Lissajous-like figures, not needed to be closed, prefered to be different (Choose from your own or Asif)
4. 3 different damping paths, different values for q.
5. Conservation of energy 
6. Conservation of angular momentum 

### Animations
1. Circular motion
2. Drawing a closed path
3. An open (not closed) lissajous-like figure
4. Implemented version of constrained motion (Simple harmonic motion in the hemisphere and projectile motion outside it)
