# Table of graphs & animation:
Type down the graphs or animations you think we should do in the report. 

## Part 1
### Graphs
1. Phase space plots showing oscillatory motion
2. Period vs l plot
3. Period vs oscillations amplitude plot
4. Shape of C2 (Cycloid)
5. Theta vs t plot showing underdamped/overdamped behaviours
6. Amplitude vs driving frequencies for resonance
7. Fd vs amplitude to investigate chaos
8. (Poincar√© sections & Bifurcation diagrams, if there is chaos)

### Animations
1. Animations for the motion with different l's and different amplitudes, to showcase period behaviour.
2. Animations for underdamped/overdamped motion
3. Animation for motion under increasing Fd (3 Fd's in 1)
4. (Chaotic motion, if it exists)
